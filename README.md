# BucketList

The innovative bucketlist app is an application that allows users  to record and share things they want to achieve or experience before reaching a certain age meeting the needs of keeping track of their dreams and goals.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
- Just clone this repository by typing: `git clone https://github.com/Lemmah/BucketList.git`
- Switch to project directory: `cd BucketList`
- Install project requirements using python pip. But wait, you have to have some stuff before you get to this point. So these are:

### Prerequisites

- Python3.5 and above
- Python virtual environment
Just type:
```
python -V
```
in your terminal and if its not greater than or equal to 3.5, you're not in big trouble, there are tons of tutorials to get up up and running with these. Just grub one then come back when done.

### Installing

Now, you have python3 and a way of running a virtual environment. Lets set up the project environment.

1. Create your virtual environment. Usually, without any wrappers:
```
python -m venv my_venv
```
2. Start your virtual environment:
```
source my_venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install the project requirements specified in the requirements.txt file. Usually,
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This is enough to get you started.
